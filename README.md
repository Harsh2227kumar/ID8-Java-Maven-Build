# ✅ Task 8: Java Maven Build with Jenkins

This task was part of my DevOps internship where I set up a simple CI/CD workflow using **Jenkins** and **Maven** to build a basic Java project.

---

## 🚀 What I Did

- Created a simple **Java HelloWorld** application using Maven.
- Created the required `pom.xml` with Java 8 compatibility (`<source>1.8</source>`).
- Installed Jenkins on my **Windows machine using Docker**.
- Installed Maven 3.9.10 using **Jenkins Global Tool Configuration**.
- Created a **Freestyle Jenkins job**:
  - Pulled the code from this GitHub repository.
  - Used the build step: `Invoke top-level Maven targets` with goal `clean package`.
- Ran the job and verified the output with **`BUILD SUCCESS`** in the Jenkins console.
